# Univ-Finder

Simple and really minimal website that shows universities name, country, and website from around the world.
Data used from [Hipo University Domains and Names Data List & API](https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list)

## How to run
### Instal dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```
### Run Express
```sh
$ node server.js
```

### Run React
```sh
$ npm start
```

## Usage
1. Search university keyword and/or country
   Due to some problem that I could not solve at the moment, I used timed events to replace submit. So just type the name and the web will get the data and show it without pushing "enter"

2. Try saving your email in the newsletter section
   Just like the first one, just type it in and the app will save it to users.json (in root)
